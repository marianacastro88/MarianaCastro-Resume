      <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mariana Castro and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently in the pre-business major, looking to focus on a concentration in marketing. In addition to that, I am looking to double major in psychology. During my time at university, I am also looking to study abroad for a semester in Italy as I think it would be a very rewarding experience. I am originally from Bogota, Colombia and lived there for around 10 years, so I am fluent in Spanish. In moving to the United States, I learned to speak English at a high level and additionally, studied French for 6 years, achieving proficiency in the language. Going abroad to Italy would add on to my knowledge, both in languages and overall culture. So far into my career, I have taken courses in Calculus (Math022), Economics (Econ003), Computer Science (CS008) and Business (Bus010) that have prepared me for this specific field. I look forward to further progressing in my studies and becoming more competent in the field. 

      <br><br>

        In the past, I have held two different paying positions. The first one, a tutoring job which I maintained throughout middle school and high school, allowed me to interact with both children and classmates in an attempt to collaborate and educate them. Along with tutoring, I ventured into the actual work force by working a retail job for over a year. As a sales associate at Old Navy, I was able to really understand the way that businesses are run and what is required for a corporate company to succeed. On top of that, I learned valuable customer service skills by working at the register, the dressing room and on the floor along with also gaining great teamwork and collaboration skills by building important rapports with those around me. At Old Navy, I was able to become a much more organized member of a team.<br><br>

      <br><br>
        On top of work experience, I have been able to have a lot of volunteer experience. As a member of the California Scholarship Federation for 4 years, I logged in over 100 hours of volunteer work at my school and around the community. This consisted of recycling, picking up trash, helping set up events ranging from marathons and robotics tournaments to basketball games and dances. In addition, I was a member of Kids Against Hunger and Project SmARTS, which were clubs designed to put volunteering to work in directly helping children, whether it was packing meals or making arts and crafts. In addition to volunteer work, I worked on projects and presentations in the Future Business Leaders of America club for two years, I was a member of the spirit group at my school called Cat Clique, consisting of painting and cheering fellow students at events and I was the secretary of the Black Student x Latino Student Union, creating presentations and leading conversation at our meetings. Iâ€™m interested in all different areas of human interaction and have participated in such over the last couple of years.
